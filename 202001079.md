**IT314                   SOFTWARE ENGINEERING LAB-1**

Name -> *Kartik Dangi* ID -> *202001079*

**Question 1.** Identify FRs and NFRs:

The institute has been recently set up to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the field of Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by

the institution. As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting

at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has

administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.

The final deliverable would be a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should run only within the institute LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a large extent, care should be taken no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in plain text.



Functional Requirements ->

- Library Information System (LIS) should be developed as the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time.

- LIS should enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting at his desk/chamber.

- There should be a proper and secured implementation of the login/signup feature.

- It is necessary to keep track of all the information necessary for the proper operation of the library, including the staff, members, and assets.

- The librarian should have administrative privileges and complete control over the system.

- A web application should be developed using the latest HTML5. 

- This web application should be fully secured and its UI should be user friendly.

- Server for this web application should be fast and reliable.

- This web application should run only within the institute LAN.



Non-Functional Requirements ->

- The librarian should be able to add a new record whenever a new book has been purchased.

- The librarian should be able to remove a record in case any book is taken off the shelf.

- A member should be able to extend the date of his borrowing if no other booking for that particular book has been made.

- A member who has borrowed the book should be notified 24 hours before the deadline for his book submission if he/she has not returned the book yet.

- Issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.

- Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books online.

- A proper care should be taken that no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in plain text.

- Output delay should be as minimum as possible.




**Question 2.** Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects.

Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies, where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.

Scope ->

- Creating a smartphone application which will help those who suffer from disabling hearing loss.
- It uses AI (Artificial Intelligence) to recognize key sound events like car horns where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user.

Features ->

- Gives immediate alerts for identifying sound events.
- Continual Logging helps the users who are suffering.
- Storing sound events information so that it can be used further.

Non-Functional Aspects ->

- Working in real time.
- Optimized for android.
- Low-Latency to ensure real time functionality.
